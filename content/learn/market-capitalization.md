Market capitalization (market cap) is one of the most fundamental metrics in stock investing. It tells us the total value of a company's outstanding shares and helps investors make informed decisions about their investments.

## What You'll Learn
* How market capitalization is calculated
* Different market cap categories and their characteristics
* Using market cap for investment decisions
* Important considerations and related concepts
* Risk assessment using market cap

## Prerequisites
* Basic understanding of stocks and shares
* Familiarity with basic math calculations
* Knowledge of stock market fundamentals

## What is Market Capitalization?

Market capitalization is calculated by multiplying a company's current stock price by its total number of outstanding shares:

```
Market Cap = Current Stock Price × Total Number of Outstanding Shares
```

For example, if a company has 1 million shares outstanding and its stock trades at $50 per share, its market cap would be $50 million.

## Why is Market Cap Important?

Market capitalization helps investors:
* Understand a company's size and relative value in the market
* Assess potential investment risks and opportunities
* Compare companies across different sectors
* Build diversified portfolios

## Market Cap Categories

Companies are typically classified into different categories based on their market capitalization:

### Large-cap Companies ($10+ billion)
* Generally considered more stable
* Often well-established industry leaders
* Usually pay regular dividends
* Example: Apple Inc., with a market cap over $2 trillion

### Mid-cap Companies ($2-10 billion)
* Balance of growth potential and stability
* Often established in specific market niches
* May be expanding into new markets

### Small-cap Companies ($300M-2 billion)
* Higher growth potential
* Usually newer or niche companies
* Generally more volatile
* May offer greater returns but with higher risk

### Micro-cap Companies (Below $300M)
* Highest risk category
* Often new companies or those in difficult situations
* Most volatile price movements
* Limited trading volume

## How to Use Market Cap in Investment Decisions

### Risk Assessment
* Larger market caps generally indicate more stable investments
* Smaller market caps might offer more growth potential but with higher risk

### Portfolio Diversification
* Include different market cap sizes to balance risk and potential returns
* Match market cap exposure to your investment goals and risk tolerance

### Industry Comparison
* Compare companies of similar market cap within the same industry
* Understand a company's competitive position in its market

## Important Considerations

Remember that market cap is just one metric among many:
* It doesn't account for debt or cash holdings
* Stock prices can be temporarily inflated or depressed
* Market conditions can affect different market cap segments differently

## Related Concepts

* **Float-Adjusted Market Cap**: Accounts only for shares available for public trading
* **Enterprise Value**: Total company value including debt and excluding cash
* **Outstanding Shares**: Total number of shares issued by a company

* Different market cap categories (large, mid, small, micro) have distinct characteristics
* Use market cap alongside other metrics for comprehensive analysis
* Consider market cap when building a diversified portfolio
* Remember that market cap is just one of many important metrics
